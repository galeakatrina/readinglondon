							<p>This project aims to look at ‘leftover’ spaces within the city, seeing them as territories of potential for natural processes rather than as useless remnants. They are fragments which are often overlooked, yet are embedded in the fabric of our everyday lives. Compared to the well-maintained and manicured public spaces within a fast-growing city,  these pockets are a celebration of the untamed - they serve as subtle reminders of the pure natural processes of growth, migration and decay. Just as the buildings erected, the people present and the events that happen within, the presence of untamed nature occupying leftover spaces also contributes to a place’s memory.  </p>
							<p> </p>
							<p>Gilles Clément identifies these spaces as the Third Landscape, the sum of all the human-disturbed land through which natural processes still occur. (Clément, G., 1999). The Third Landscape designates the sum of the space left over by man to landscape evolution – to nature alone. This constitues transitional spaces, abandoned land and ruins, roadsides, railroad embankments, shores, and more. </p>
							<p> </p>
							<p>For this project, a few spots around the second urban walk presented in the module (the walk around Canning Town and  Silvertown) were identified - zones in which different kinds of leftover spaces are examples of Third Landscapes. These sites vary in kind, scale and constituents, yet are all equally important examples of nature reclaiming those spaces which may be neglected and forgotten by man.  </p>
							<p> </p>
							<p>The toolkit presented in this virtual sketchbook aims to reveal these ecosystems and highlight their presence - by attempting to recreate an ‘x-ray vision’, cutting through the layers of the built to reveal new hybrids of the natural and the man-made. A website has been created (from scratch) to replace the physicality of a sketchbook - it is not intended to be formal, and is limitedly formatted in order to keep the sketchy aesthetic of a sketchbook.</p>
